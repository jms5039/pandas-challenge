BCS Learning Assistant helped me on 12/8/2023 with renaming the index. BCS Learning Assistant provided me with df = df.rename_axis('').

Tasks:
- Analyze the district-wide standardized test results.
- Aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Instructions:
Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data:
	- District Summary
	    - Total number of unique schools
	    - Total students
	    - Total budget
	    - Average math score
	    - Average reading score
	    - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
	    - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
	    - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

	- School Summary
	    - School name
	    - School type
	    - Total students
	    - Total school budget
	    - Per student budget
	    - Average math score
	    - Average reading score
	    - % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
	    - % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
	    - % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

	- Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
	    - Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows

	- Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
            - Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.

	- Math Scores by Grade
	    - list the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

	- Reading Scores by Grade
	    - lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

	- Scores by School Spending
	    - Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).

	- Scores by School Size
	    - Create a DataFrame called size_summary that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).

	- Scores by School Type
	    - show school performance based on the "School Type".
